semantic: Noinit does not exhibit the specified behavior when applied to a variable of class type.

My expectations on reading the spec was that the variable would be left
uninitialized and probably lead to a segfault.  Instead the class variable is
value-initialized to nil even when the "= noinit" initializer is present.

My recommendation is to update the spec, so the expected behavior is that class
variables are always initialized to nil.
