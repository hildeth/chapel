bug: Initialization is not assignment.

Following the implementation of default constructor calls, this test fails for a
different reason.  The number of constructor and destructor calls match up, but
the initialization sequence for r is
  default-construct r
  default-construct tmp (== new R()).
  assign tmp to r.
Whereas what is desired is:
  default-construct tmp (== new R()).
  copy-construct r (tmp).

For this reason, I am leaving this test case as a future.  For reference, the
previous future text appears below.

bug: Destructor called too many times for a record var with explicit new.

A record variable at module scope is initialized with an explicit new.  The
user's default constructor is called, but the destructor is called twice.  This
would be an error with a reference-counted type, since it could lead to
double-deletion unless the reference counting implementation protects for this
internally.
